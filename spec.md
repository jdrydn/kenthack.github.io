# #Kenthack

A hackathon for students (*& teens*) around Canterbury.

Hosted by the University of Kent.

A weekend of hacking and putting stuff together.

* Pitch
  * People pitch their ideas and see if other people want to join their team.
  * Audience votes for ideas that they like.
  * We narrow it down so ideas have at least a developer.
  *	OR
  *	People can work on their own stuff, in pre-formed teams.
* Hack
  * Teams spend the day, a night, and a day hacking away at their projects.
  * e.g. Tuesday, Tuesday night, & Wednesday.
* Present
  * At the end of the hacking, the teams need to present their projects, what it does, why it does it, and how they could expand.

Come along as an individual or a team, with or without an idea.

All `code` produced must be fresh (i.e. Only written during the event). Existing startups are okay, as long as the new stuff is new features / prototypes, and not just working on existing stuff.

Would like to have talks throughout the event on different areas. I.e:

* **Shane** talking about his `WebcamJS` or about `NodeJS`.
* A lecturer talking about `Java`?
* Microsoft representation talking about Windows?
  * *Blake?*

Could be open to teens & students outside of UKC, but that makes getting resources harder (people outside UKC don't have access to eduroam)

## What I need

* **Space**
  * A lecture theatre for presentations, and some seminar rooms / terminals for hacking?
  * Potential locations:
    * Rutherford Dining Hall?
    * Woolf College?
    * Music room by Gulbenkian?
* Food & drink?
* Judges?
  * For the presentations?
  * Investors / VCs?
  * Computing School?
  * Kent Business School?
* **When?**
  * Project Week in Spring 2013?
    * What's happening then?
  * After exams?

## Example Schedule

  * People setup & register their teams.
* Opening talk
