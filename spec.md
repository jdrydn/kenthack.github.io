# #kenthack

This is an initial draft of a spec for a hackathon at the University of Kent. If you have any questions or want to get in touch, please get in touch (*see the bottom of this page for details*)!

## When

* Project Week in Spring 2013?
* After exams?

## What

A hackathon for students (*& teens*) around Canterbury.

> **Hackathon:** A hackathon is an event where designers, developers and entrepreneurs get together to form new ideas and create new projects and prototypes over a short period of time.
> 
> [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)

Hosted by the University of Kent.

A two-day event of hacking and building prototypes.

Usually with prizes at the end, in recognition of awesome work and excellent teams!

### Format

* Pitch
  * People pitch their ideas and see if other people want to join their team.
  * Audience votes for ideas that they like.
  * We narrow it down so ideas have at least a developer.
  *	OR
  *	People can work on their own stuff, in pre-formed teams.
* Hack
  * Teams spend the day, a night, and a day hacking away at their projects.
  * e.g. Tuesday, Tuesday night, & Wednesday.
* Present
  * At the end of the hacking, the teams need to present their projects, what it does, why it does it, and how they could expand.

Come along as an individual or a team, with or without an idea.

All `code` produced must be fresh (i.e. Only written during the event). Existing startups are okay, as long as the new stuff is new features / prototypes, and not just working on existing stuff.

Would like to have talks throughout the event on different areas. I.e:

* *Shane* talking about his `WebcamJS` or about `NodeJS`.
* A lecturer talking about `Java`?
* Microsoft representation talking about Windows development? *Blake?*
* I'll happily chat about `entities` `:D`
* Would love to get some real APIs and sponsors in:
  * Twilio? *Stevie Graham?*
  * Pusher? *Phil Leggat?*
  * Redbull?
  * Dominoes?

Could be open to teens & students outside of UKC, but that makes getting resources harder (people outside UKC don't have access to eduroam)

### Open source

I am playing with the idea that we should encourage all projects to be open source, or at least the code produced during the event should be released on GitHub. I have setup a [**#kenthack** organisation on GitHub][github] that could hold all the repositories and all the code, and all I will need to do is create teams and repos and add people to them (so they can push their code to it).

<!--
What if people don't have GitHub? They'll have to get it? (They are free accounts..?) No point in having our own SVN and Trac repo, because that will mean EVERYBODY needs to sign up :/
-->

**Why?** To remind people that they don't have to finish an entire project by the end of the event. They should have fun, build a prototype, and not worry about security (yet!). The code should be released online, and if they want to take it further then they should be adding in all the security, extra layers, new features, etc.

It's also a good way to put items on your CV. Public items on the web demonstrates work and shows confidence in it. 

Employers (especially employers for startups and other small businesses) love seeing code examples on the web. Imagine what they think when they see something like this in a CV:

> I attended **kenthack**, a hackathon based at my university, where I made FindMe, a people tracking app for Androids. Published to GitHub after the event.
> http://github.com/kenthack/2012-FindMe

Repository names should follow a "{Year}-{Name}" structure (`kenthack/2012-myamazingproject`), and we add people's GitHub accounts to teams on the **kenthack** page, and then link teams to each repository so they can push and pull code `:)`.

<!--
Will need to create an admin / helper team, and add that team to all repos so helpers can push and pull code to help people :)
-->

Obviously this won't be enforced. If people don't want their code public then that is their decision. But it should definitely be encouraged. And made as simple to do!

GitHub, based on Git, also offers version control, which make coding in teams really simple `:)` We can also offer help to those new / having difficulties with Git & GitHub, since the helpers I have in mind are fairly confident and proficient with Git.

I've setup an example repo - what I imagine a repo would look like after a hackathon - for you to see. The repo is at [github.com/kenthack/2012-example](//github.com/kenthack/2012-example) and the site for it is at [kenthack.com/2012-example](//kenthack.com/2012-example) (*The site itself is a [simple Github pages site](//pages.github.com), on the gh-pages branch of the Github repo. Because it's under the **kenthack** repo on Github, the gh-pages site gets put under the **kenthack.com** domain!*).

### What I need

* Space
  * A lecture theatre for presentations, and some seminar rooms / terminals for hacking?
  * Desk space, power extension leads, etc.
  * Networking (although isn't required if it's only uni students attending since they can connect to **eduroam**).
  * Potential locations:
    * Rutherford Dining Hall?
    * Woolf College?
    * Music room by Gulbenkian?
    * Darwin - The Missing Link
* Food & drink?
  * Considering sponsors for food?
* Judges?
  * For the presentations?
  * Investors / VCs?
  * Computing School?
  * Kent Business School?
* Helpers
  * Although I have a couple of people in mind, it would be nice to have some volunteers to help with running the event!
    * (Could contact *KentUnion* to ask about *E&V* support and getting their involvement?)

### Example Schedule

* Doors open
  * People setup & register their teams.
* Opening talk
  * And quick introductions to other talks that will take place during the hacking.
  * Pitches
  * Voting for pitches.
  * Register the new teams.
    * Create GitHub repos for each team and link all the members to the GitHub repo.
* Hacking.
  * With talks throughout the night.
* Presentations
  * Introduction to teams.
  * Each team:
    * Has five minutes to demo their project.
    * Questions from judges & audience.
  * Judges talk?
  * Prizes & closing talk.

### Who is this aimed at?

This is aimed at students in Canterbury. Specifically, University of Kent students, since we don't have internet access for non-students, and I don't know of any way round that (excluding Internet Sharing options, which I don't want to do since it's nasty `:/`).

Students of all ages. From first-years to post-graduates. This may appear to present an unfair advantage - pitching a group of first years against a group of graduates. Whilst at first this appears to be true, (a) in the real world age doesn't matter, so I don't see why it should apply here, and (b) I've attended a hackathon where a group of (then) first-years took on people well into their twenties, and came out successful. So age really doesn't matter. Plus, you never know, they could work together and produce something even more awesome `^_^`.

Obviously, if we have prizes and awards and stuff, there would be one specific for each year group. "*Best Stage 1 project*", "*Best Stage 2 project*", "*Best Stage 3 project*", "*Best Postgraduate project*", "*Best Undergraduate project*", etc etc.

## Why

I've been to four hackathons in my free time whilst being at University. And I have loved them all. So much so that I would like to host one at Uni to give other students who haven't been to a hackathon a taste of what they're about.

Hackathons are beneficial to students because they encourage students to be creative, and not program just for assessments. A lot of coursework involves programming to solve a problem, or a real-world problem. Which is great. But that restricts a lot of creativity. Some of the best projects, apps, programs, websites, etc. come from people thinking "*If only there was an app that did that...*".

Hackathons are the perfect time for developers, designers & entrepreneurs to simply be creative. And at the University, we have a wide range of developers in *Computer Science* courses, a wide range of designers in *Graphic Design & Media* courses and a wide range of entrepreneurs in *Business* courses. So it's about time we get everyone together and come up with the "next big thing"!

Of course, teams may not come up with the next big thing. They could create a little one-off project that gets some laughs and entertains us! And that's even cooler! :)

## Getting in touch

If you have any queries or want to get involved with **#kenthack** you can get in touch with the team by [emailing hello@kenthack.com][email-hello], [like us on facebook][facebook] or [follow us on twitter][twitter]. Or if you'd prefer you can [email James directly][email-james].

And please do get in touch! I want this hackathon to be absolutely amazing, and I can't do it alone!

Kind regards,

James
